Each item in the list is a pair: pattern, responses.The pattern is a regular expression The responses are a list of possible replies. The last pattern r"(.*)" is a catch-all that matches anything â€” it acts as a fallback.- Uses re.search() to check if the pattern matches the user input. Converts the user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching. Iterates through each pattern in the pairs list.
 If a match is found, it randomly selects a response from the corresponding list.If no match is found (which is rare due to the fallback), it returns a default message.
